The project is based on a single-page application called BookStore, an online bookshop where users can select their favorite books to read later and mark books they have already read. The main features of this web app include:

1. Selecting multiple books for future reading or to mark as already read.
2. Viewing the book list sorted by publishing year, rating, or number of pages.
3. Displaying a chart based on the pages of each collected book.
4. Providing feedback after reading any book.
5. Ensuring data persistence so that listed books are retained even if the user closes or revisits the web app.
